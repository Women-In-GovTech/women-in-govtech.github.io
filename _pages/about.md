The Women in GovTech Community aims to create a supportive community for young professional women who are working in government technology roles. 🚀 
Our goal is to provide a platform for these professionals to connect, learn, and grow together in their careers in the GovTech industry. 🌱 
Through networking and educational opportunities, we hope to inspire and empower women to advance in their roles and break through the barriers that often exist in male-dominated industries. 💪 
Our club welcomes women from all backgrounds and experiences who share a passion for technology and a commitment to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. 🌈👩‍💻👩🏽‍💼💼✨
